This is the central command and control center for the YallaGo ride-hailing platform. This web-based admin dashboard is a full-stack application designed for platform owners to manage drivers, monitor trips, and ensure the safety and efficiency of the entire ecosystem. It interacts in real-time with the same Firebase backend as the customer and driver mobile apps.
